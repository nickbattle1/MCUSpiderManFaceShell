# MCUSpiderManFaceShell
This project brings to life the iconic MCU Spider-Man moving lenses faceshell using Arduino-based electronics and custom mechanical components. The faceshell features independently articulating lenses that react to facial movements, mimicking the expressive eyes from Marvel's Spider-Man suits.
